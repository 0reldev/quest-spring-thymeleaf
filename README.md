# Quest "Spring 03: Thymeleaf"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest introduces the template engine Thymeleaf, especially the use of variables, URL and fragments.

It is asked to connect each doctor's link to a personalized webpage where the number and the name is automatically updated. 

Furthermore, in the templates <code>index.html</code> and <code>doctor.html</code>, the footer and the header must be called as fragments with Thymeleaf.
